Encountered an error called "Thread 1: signal SIGABRT" whenever I tap/clicked the "Superhero" tab on the iPhone. At first I tried to clean and re-build the project but the error still shows up. To resolve the problem, I did some research and based on what I found, my Movie Grid Cell from the Main Storyboard doesn't have an identifier to link with the MovieGridCell.swift.

I was having a problem importing the AlamofireImage. Even though I installed, opened, and added the pod file correctly, I couldn't build the project since it doesn't recognize the AlamofireImage module. But one thing I did do to resolve this problem based on my research is to update the pod on the terminal and clean and build the project folder again.
